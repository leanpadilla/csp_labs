<h1> Setting up tiered technical support</h1>



    <p>
        Establishing or making changes to your <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/support-levels-level-1-level-2-level-3/"> technical support team </a> can be overwhelming, especially as your company grows.

        Developing a structure is the first step. Start with identifying your needs and circumstances. For example, a software company’s users will likely have a lot of technical issues whereas a service or retail company will have monetary or other issues. Using the tiers template above, determine what sorts of topics and issues might fit into each tier. Note that some companies use fewer tiers than the five levels (0 through 4) listed above. If you only have enough staff to support three levels, that is a fine approach!

    The role of technical support
    Technical support is a service that supports users of technology products or services. Technical support is also known
    as IT support, help desk, or service desk. In contrast to traditional training, technical support typically focuses on
    helping with a specific user problem or issue.
    
    Technical support often contributes to or supports a company’s overall customer service philosophy, so the team or
    department may straddle the technical world of IT and the practical side of customer service.
    
    Technical support may be comprised of a single employee for small companies or may include many departments and workers.
    For example, a large company like BMC often has two types of teams:
    
    An internal IT support team that helps employees when they are dealing with a technical problem.
    An external-facing support team helps customers and users of BMC’s systems.
    Technical support can be delivered in a variety of ways, depending on the support level or tier, including by phone,
    email, live chat or video, chatbots, online tutorials and how-to’s, message boards, and other logging tools. Popular
    third-party tools for help desk support include Zendesk, Salesforce, and BMC Helix, among many others.

    <p id="0"><em><strong>Tier 0</strong></em></p>
        
    <p><sup>Self-help and user-retrieved information.
    
            Users retrieve support information from web and mobile pages or apps, including FAQs, detailed product and
            technical
            information, blog posts, manuals, and search functions.
    
            Users also use apps to access service catalogs where they can request and receive services without involving the
            IT
            staff.
    
            Email, web forms, and social contact methods such as Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., are used to send questions and
            requests to
            upper support tiers or company personnel.
    
            Customer forums allow users to crowdsource solutions, usually without input from company personnel.
    
            Tier 0 requires technical and marketing resources to create, maintain, and update product information.
    
            A development team handles web site and app creation.
    
            Moderators are used to monitor customer forums.
    
            Tier 1 personnel respond to requests received through email, web sites, or social media.</sup></p>
    
    
    
    
    
      <p id="1"><em><strong>Tier 1</strong></em></p>
    
      <p>Basic help desk resolution and service desk delivery
    
        Support for basic customer issues such as solving usage problems and fulfilling service desk requests that need IT
        involvement.
    
        If no solution is available, tier 1 personnel escalate incidents to a higher tier.
    
        Lower-level technical personnel, trained to solve known problems and to fulfill service requests by following
        scripts.</sup>
        <p />
    
    
    
      <p id="2"><em><strong>Tier 2</strong></em></p>
    
      <p>In-depth technical support
    
        Experienced and knowledgeable technicians assess issues and provide solutions for problems that cannot be handled by
        tier 1.
    
        If no solution is available, tier 2 support escalates the incident to tier 3.
    
        Support personnel with deep knowledge of the product or service, but not necessarily the engineers or programmers
        who
        designed and created the product.</p>
    
    
    
    
      <p id="3"><em><strong>Tier 3</strong></em></p>
    
      <p>Expert product and service support
    
        Access to the highest technical resources available for problem resolution or new feature creation.
    
        Tier 3 technicians attempt to duplicate problems and define root causes, using product designs, code, or
        specifications.
    
        Once a cause is identified, the company decides whether to create a new fix, depending on the cause of the problem.
        New
        fixes are documented for use by Tier 1 and Tier 2 personnel.
    
        Tier 3 specialists are generally the most highly skilled product specialists, and may include the creators, chief
        architects, or engineers who created the product or service.</p>
    
    
       <p id="4"><em><strong>Tier 4</strong></em></p>
    
      <p>Outside support for problems not supported by the organization
    
        Contracted support for items provided by but not directly serviced by the organization, including printer support,
        vendor software support, machine maintenance, depot support, and other outsourced services.
    
        Problems or requests are forwarded to tier 4 support and monitored by the organization for implementation.
    
        Preferred vendors and business partners providing support and services for items provided by your company.</p>
