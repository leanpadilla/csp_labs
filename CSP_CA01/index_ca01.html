  <h1>Climate Change</h1>

  <p>
    Contemporary climate change includes both global warming and its impacts on Earth's weather patterns. There have
    been previous periods of climate change, but the current changes are distinctly more rapid and not due to natural
    causes.[2] Instead, they are caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane.
    Burning fossil fuels for energy use creates most of these emissions. Agriculture, steelmaking, cement production,
    and forest loss are additional sources.[3] Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, allowing it through to heat
    the Earth's surface. When the Earth emits that heat as infrared radiation the gases absorb it, trapping the heat
    near the Earth's surface. As the planet heats up it causes changes like the loss of sunlight-reflecting snow cover,
    amplifying global warming.[4]

    On land, temperatures have risen about twice as fast as the global average. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves
    and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost,
    glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms and other weather
    extremes.[7] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to
    relocate or become extinct.[8] Climate change threatens people with food and water scarcity, increased flooding,
    extreme heat, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can be a result.[9] The World Health
    Organization calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.[10] Even if efforts to
    minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include sea level rise, and
    warmer, more acidic oceans.[11]

    Before the 1980s, it was unclear whether warming by increased greenhouse gases would dominate aerosol-induced
    cooling. Scientists then often used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to the human impact on the
    climate. In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change were popularised. The former refers only to
    increased surface warming, the latter describes the full effect of greenhouse gases on the climate.[20] Global
    warming became the most popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the
    U.S. Senate.[21] In the 2000s, the term climate change increased in popularity.[22] Global warming usually refers to
    human-induced warming of the Earth system, whereas climate change can refer to natural or anthropogenic change.[23]
    The two terms are often used interchangeably.[24]


  </p>

  <p>Various scientists, politicians and media figures have adopted the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to
    talk about climate change, and global heating instead of global warming.[25] The policy editor-in-chief of The
    Guardian said they included this language in their editorial guidelines "to ensure that we are being scientifically
    precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue".[26] In 2019, Oxford Languages
    chose climate emergency as its word of the year, defining it as "a situation in which urgent action is required to
    reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it".[27][28]
