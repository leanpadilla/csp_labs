    <h1>Climate Change</h1>

    <p>
      Contemporary climate change includes both global warming and its impacts on Earth's weather patterns. There have
      been previous periods of climate change, but the current changes are distinctly more rapid and not due to natural
      causes.[2] Instead, they are caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane.
      Burning fossil fuels for energy use creates most of these emissions. Agriculture, steelmaking, cement production,
      and forest loss are additional sources.[3] Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, allowing it through to
      heat
      the Earth's surface. When the Earth emits that heat as infrared radiation the gases absorb it, trapping the heat
      near the Earth's surface. As the planet heats up it causes changes like the loss of sunlight-reflecting snow
      cover,
      amplifying global warming.[4]
    </p>

    <p>
      On land, temperatures have risen about twice as fast as the global average. Deserts are expanding, while heat
      waves
      and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost,
      glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms and other weather
      extremes.[7] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to
      relocate or become extinct.[8] Climate change threatens people with food and water scarcity, increased flooding,
      extreme heat, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can be a result.[9] The World Health
      Organization calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.[10] Even if efforts to
      minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include sea level rise,
      and warmer, more acidic oceans.[11]
    </p>


    <p>
      Many of these impacts are already felt at the current level of warming (1.2 °C). Additional warming will increase
      these impacts and may trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.[12] Under the 2015
      Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2 °C". However, with pledges made under
      the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C by the end of the century.[13] Limiting warming to
      1.5 °C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.[14]



    </p>

    <p>
      Making deep cuts in emissions will require switching away from burning fossil fuels and towards using electricity
      generated from low-carbon sources. This includes phasing out coal-fired power plants, vastly increasing use of
      wind, solar, and other types of renewable energy, switching to electric vehicles, switching to heat pumps in
      buildings, and taking measures to conserve energy.[15][16] Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for
      instance by increasing forest cover.[17] While communities may adapt to climate change through efforts like better
      coastline protection, they cannot avert the risk of severe, widespread, and permanent impacts.[18

      <h1>Terminology</h1>
      <p>
        Before the 1980s, it was unclear whether warming by increased greenhouse gases would dominate aerosol-induced
        cooling. Scientists then often used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to the human impact on
        the
        climate. In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change were popularised. The former refers only to
        increased surface warming, the latter describes the full effect of greenhouse gases on the climate.[20] Global
        warming became the most popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in
        the
        U.S. Senate.[21] In the 2000s, the term climate change increased in popularity.[22] Global warming usually
        refers
        to
        human-induced warming of the Earth system, whereas climate change can refer to natural or anthropogenic
        change.[23]
        The two terms are often used interchangeably.[24]
      </p>

      <p>Various scientists, politicians and media figures have adopted the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to
        talk about climate change, and global heating instead of global warming.[25] The policy editor-in-chief of The
        Guardian said they included this language in their editorial guidelines "to ensure that we are being
        scientifically
        precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue".[26] In 2019, Oxford
        Languages
        chose climate emergency as its word of the year, defining it as "a situation in which urgent action is required
        to
        reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from
        it".[27][28]

      <h2>Observed temperature rise</h2>

      <p>
        Multiple independent instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming.[31] The 2011–2020 decade
        warmed
        to an average 1.09 °C [0.95–1.20 °C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900).[32] Surface
        temperatures
        are rising by about 0.2 °C per decade,[33] with 2020 reaching a temperature of 1.2 °C above the pre-industrial
        era.[34] Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights
        has
        increased.[35]
      </p>

      <p>
        There was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century. Climate information for that
        period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores.[36] Thermometer records began to provide global
        coverage around 1850.[37] Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the
        Little Ice Age, did not occur at the same time across different regions. Temperatures may have reached as high
        as
        those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions.[38] There have been prehistorical episodes of global
        warming, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum.[39] However, the modern observed rise in temperature and
        CO2 concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events in Earth's history do not approach
        current rates.[
      </p>

      <p>
        Evidence of warming from air temperature measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other
        observations.[41][42] There has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting
        of
        snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity.[43] Flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner
        consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring.[44] Another key indicator is the
        cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth's
        surface and preventing it from radiating into space.

      <h3>Regional aspects to temperature rises</h3>

      <p>
        Regions of the world warm at differing rates. The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted,
        because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, the average
        surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface
        temperature.[46] This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by
        evaporation.[47] The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least
        1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean.[48][49] The rest has heated the
        atmosphere,
        melted ice, and warmed the continents.[50]
      </p>

      <p>
        The Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere.
        The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice. As these
        surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more
        heat.[51] Local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming.[52] Arctic temperatures
        are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world.[53] Melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the
        Arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened Gulf Stream, further changing the climate.[54]

      <h4> Drivers of recent temperature rise</h4>
      <p>
        The climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years (such as the El Niño–Southern
        Oscillation), decades or even centuries.[55] Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is
        "external" to the climate system, but not always external to the Earth.[56] Examples of external forcings
        include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations
        in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.[57]

        To determine the human contribution to climate change, known internal climate variability and natural external
        forcings need to be ruled out. A key approach is to determine unique "fingerprints" for all potential causes,
        then compare these fingerprints with observed patterns of climate change.[58] For example, solar forcing can be
        ruled out as a major cause. Its fingerprint would be warming in the entire atmosphere. Yet, only the lower
        atmosphere has warmed, consistent with greenhouse gas forcing.[59] Attribution of recent climate change shows
        that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, with aerosols having a dampening effect.[60]

      <h5>Greenhouse Gases</h5>
      <p>
        The Earth absorbs sunlight, then radiates it as heat. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and reemit
        infrared radiation, slowing the rate at which it can pass through the atmosphere and escape into space.[61]
        Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the
        surface to be about 33 °C warmer than it would have been in their absence.[62][63] While water vapour (~50%) and
        clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature
        and are therefore feedbacks. On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as CO2 (~20%), tropospheric
        ozone,[64] CFCs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore external forcing

      <h6>Aerosol and clouds</h6>
      <p>

        Air pollution, in the form of aerosols, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also affects the
        climate on a large scale.[75] From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the
        Earth's surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming,[76] typically attributed to
        aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning.[77] Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990, meaning
        that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.[78]

        Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation. They also have indirect effects on the Earth's radiation budget.
        Sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets.
        These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets.[79] They also
        reduce the growth of raindrops, which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight.[80] Indirect effects of
        aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.[81]

        While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or
        ice can contribute to global warming. Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases
        melting and sea-level rise.[82] Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by
        0.2 °C by 2050.[
