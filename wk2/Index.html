<h1> Setting up tiered technical support</h1>



    <p>
        Establishing or making changes to your <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/support-levels-level-1-level-2-level-3/"> technical support team </a> can be overwhelming, especially as your company grows.

        Developing a structure is the first step. Start with identifying your needs and circumstances. For example, a software companyâ€™s users will likely have a lot of technical issues whereas a service or retail company will have monetary or other issues. Using the tiers template above, determine what sorts of topics and issues might fit into each tier. Note that some companies use fewer tiers than the five levels (0 through 4) listed above. If you only have enough staff to support three levels, that is a fine approach!
